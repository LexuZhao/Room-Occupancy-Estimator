# Room-Occupancy-Estimator
Our goal is to design and execute a machine-learning model that estimates room occupancy based on temperature, light, sound, CO2, and digital passive infrared (PIR) data. We will use data provided by UCI, which consists of 10,129 instances and 16 attributes. To generate an accurate model predicting room occupancy, we used Random Forest and referenced published data as our performance benchmark. We start with feature transformation, to have more features available for training, then with the goal of constructing an efficient model, we tried to minimize the number of features used for prediction by using a careful feature selection. Girdsearch cross-validation was also performed to improve our prediction accuracy. By executing this project, we successfully construct a model that accurately estimates room occupancy, which can be used to optimize energy consumption and improve building management. The result suggests that our optimized model, compared to both the reference literature as well as the initial model we constructed, not only takes in fewer features but also has better performance. The experience gained in this project demonstrates the crucial importance of fine-tuning models as well as feature selection. The model construction process also provides us with more insight into which sensor is most useful in occupancy estimation.
